Remove the OEM battery from the IMA bay.

Remove the NiMH sticks from the battery enclosure.

Let's look at the OEM parts you're going to need to use LiBCM:

Next let's look at the LiBCM kit.  With any luck, I've sent all the parts shown in this video:
Step 1:

The first step is to modify the OEM MCM'E' & temperature cables for use with LiBCM.  This video editing is really bad... I made a technical mistake at some point and didn't realize until much later... in my attempt to edit a cohesive video together, I've created a linearly, technically correct list of steps, but it's a bit choppy aesthetically:

The audio volume is quiet in the next few videos... I was filming this video at 4AM, with my wife sleeping in the next room over... also, the microphone wasn't placed well.  Again, I'll be re-recording the entire installation process with better equipment and a wireless microphone for general release.

Next let's install the batteries.  Remember you're dealing with high voltage.  Don't touch more than one thing at a time!

Next we'll install the PCB and the various wires that plug into it:

Now let's throw the complete pack into the IMA bay, load the firmware, and talk through a beta quirk (that will go away with better firmware):

The MVP firmware I mentioned in this video is here:
https://github.com/doppelhub/Honda_Insight_LiBCM/MVP/MVP.ino

If you are using the "+40% current hack", then no code changes are required.
If you are using the OEM current settings, then comment out line 172 (as of this writing) in MVP.ino.  Specifically, add '//' to the beginning of line 172:
//battCurrent_amps = (int16_t)(battCurrent_amps * 0.7);

...

Finally, here's how to route the wires in the middle mat area:
