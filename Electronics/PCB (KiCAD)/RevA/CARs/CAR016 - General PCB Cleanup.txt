The wire hole for Bay 1 fan cuts through ground plane.

C27 silkscreen covered by other silkscreen

isoSPI too close to off-line HVDC- (pre-filtered).

isoSPI should have ground plane underneath it to prevent EMI

If possible, rotate bay 3 fan's wire hole for better wire routing on back of PCB.

Reroute HVDC so that pack voltage goes through fuse, then cap, then HVDCDC.

HVDC 8pin screw terminal probably blocked by aluminum shaft that bolts from PDU to IMA battery.

Remove Redundant Neutral & GND Vias

Move HVDCDC inward 0.1" to prevent interference with enclosure.  Same with cap and fuse.
