The rows are flipped on the BCM connector.  Essentially the upper and lower rows all need to be swapped.  For example, B01 & B12 should be swapped, as should B02 & B13, etc.  All pins are wrong.


Workaround:
Manually repin external IMA wire harness.

Final Implementation:
Flipped pins around.
Note that KiCAD wouldn't update the footprint until I deleted the old one and re-placed it.
