When the onboard fans are turned on, the 12 volts rail (generated from HVDC) sometimes browns out.  Need to add more capacitance to 12 volt rail near fan connector.

This is an intermittent issue... possibly related to MCM status.
When the issue exists, it's very reproducible.
When the issue doesn't occur, it's almost impossible to reproduce.

Root Cause:
This only occurs when Lambda Gen is connected to 12 volt rail, but its output is disabled.  Could not reproduce except under that condition.

Solution:
No action needed.  Test equipment caused issue.
