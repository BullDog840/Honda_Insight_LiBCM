Not sure what's wrong with current sensor op-amp circuit.  It's linear, but isn't full scale like it should be.  Empirical data I gathered tonight:

125A Assist: 3.0 volts
125A Regen: 0.4 volts (although this was probably clipping, since only designed for 80 A or so.

Solution:
Wrong Rsense value used.  RevA has two 82 Ohm resistors in parallel (so 41 Ohms), whereas Rsense should be 82 Ohms total (so 82 Ohms).

With 82 Ohms the ADC can sense from 70 A regen to 140 A assist.

To prevent accuracy issues due to Rsense heating, should place QTY4 82 Ohm resistors (2S2P).
