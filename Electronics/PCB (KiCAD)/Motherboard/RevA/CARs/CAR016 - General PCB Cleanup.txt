The wire hole for Bay 1 fan cuts through ground plane.

C27 silkscreen covered by other silkscreen

If possible, rotate bay 3 fan's wire hole for better wire routing on back of PCB.  Or just add another hole.

Reroute HVDC so that pack voltage goes through fuse, then cap, then HVDCDC.

HVDC 8pin screw terminal probably blocked by aluminum shaft that bolts from PDU to IMA battery.

Move HVDCDC inward 0.1" to prevent interference with enclosure.  Same with cap and fuse.

Add revB logo somewhere.
Add open source hardware logo.

Clean up opamp area/ground.

Add ground planes to GND_ISO_C/etc

Switch bottom-side traces to top-side near Fan mounting holes
