For lower cost version, add ability to power LiBCM using car's 12 volt battery.  Note that this will prevent cell balancing... only monitoring.

Final Implementation:
Added DNP resistor from IGA1 (12V+10s) to 12 volt rail.
This allows us to remove:
-fans
-HVDCDC
-Entire HVDC circuit (connector/isolation/fuse/capacitors)
-entire HVAC circuit (IGBT/isolation/IEC cable, fuse)
-CC LED grid charger
-discharge resistors
-QTY2 (of QTY3) 220 uF electrolytic capacitors

People can still add a resistor divider to R48 (VPIN), and MCM 'E' (using R69/R70/R71/R72/DNP).
