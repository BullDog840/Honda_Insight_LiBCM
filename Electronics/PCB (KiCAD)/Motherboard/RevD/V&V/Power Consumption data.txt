LiBCM consumes on average 1.4 watts with grid charger plugged in.

LiBCM consumes 1% SoC/month with IMA switch off, due to LTC6804 power draw (28 mW).

When LiBCM 5V off, LiBCM consumes:
171 uA @ Vin=120
210 uA @ Vin=100
265 uA @ Vin= 80
440 uA @ Vin= 50
788 uA @ Vin= 30
2240uA @ Vin= 13
Turns off @ Vin ~9V

...

When LiBCM 5V on and keyOFF, LiBCM consumes:
4.5 mA @ Vin=120.0 (540 mW)
3.3 mA @ Vin=183.5 (606 mW)
This includes both HVDCDC and LTC6804
