J22 text in schematic pdf is incorrect:

RevD (Incorrect):
VCC
SCK
MOSI
MISO
GPIO0
CS_EXT
GND
GND

Correct:
VCC
MOSI
SCK
MISO
GPIO0
CS_EXT
GND
GND

To fix:
Swap "MOSI" and "SCK" text.  The electrical connections should not change.
The silkscreen doesn't change... just the text for J22 in the schematic.
The silkscreen on both RevC and RevD is correct.
