Existing hardware only has HVDC<->GND capacitors from HVDC- to GND_ENG.
It's possible we need a complimentary pair going from HVDC+ to GND_ENG.

Another thought is that both these capacitor pairs should go to GND_CHASSIS (instead of GND_ENG).  However, that would be difficult since GND_ENG is used inside LiBCM.

Solution:

Added coupling capacitors from HVDC_POS_FUSED to 12NEG_RAW.

Done
