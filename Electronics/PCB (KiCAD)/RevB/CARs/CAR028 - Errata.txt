Change R82 to cheaper resistor (7xkOhm)

P&P: C151 won't place if small tip installed on left nozzle.  X travel limit.
Solution: Make C151 larger cap (68 nF), and place 22 nF on C152
Note: I've already made this change to the P&P file

D5 'diode' silkcreen is backwards... need to flip silkscreen symbol 180 degrees.

D16 replaced with 82R0 (see CAR029)

Consider removing constant 5 volt load (or not, it's FET controlled)

Cover LTC6804s & LTC6820 with conformal coating after FVT

Make cable from 3+ to 2- 20 mm longer (no aid assembly)
