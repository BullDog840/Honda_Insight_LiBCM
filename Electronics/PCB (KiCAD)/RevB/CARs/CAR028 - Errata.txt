Change R82 to cheaper resistor (7xkOhm)

P&P: C151 won't place if small tip installed on left nozzle.  X travel limit.
Solution: Make C151 larger cap (68 nF), and place 22 nF on C152
Note: I've already made this change to the P&P file (need to change on schematic)

D5 'diode' silkcreen is backwards... need to flip silkscreen symbol 180 degrees.

Consider removing constant 5 volt load (or not, it's FET controlled)

Cover LTC6804s & LTC6820 with conformal coating after FVT

Add note:
Since cell 18+ (on J13) is connected to cell 19- (on J16), small portion of assist/regen current can flow through this trace.  This causes lower than actual C18 & C19 voltage readings during heave assist, and higher than actual C18 & C19 voltage readings during regen.  Based on my testing:
-  -52 A regen  causes C18 & C19 to be ~50 mV higher than all other cells
- +129 A assist causes C18 & C19 to be ~90 mV  lower than all other cells

This is approximately a 1 mV error per regen/assist amp.  

Ideally we'd use an 18S LTC part for 18S packs... and a 12S LTC part for 12S packs.  I don't see a way to fix this

Solution:
-R82 changed to 7k32
-Swapped C151 & C152
-Rotated D5 silkscreen
-DNP'd constant 5 volt load resistors
