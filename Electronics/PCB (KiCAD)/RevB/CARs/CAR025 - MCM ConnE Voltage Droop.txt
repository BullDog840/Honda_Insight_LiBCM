Each time MCM samples ConnE voltage (1 S/s), the load placed on the spoofed MCM ConnE circuit causes that high impedance source to droop 50 volts (as viewed with differential probe on scope).

However, this probably isn't the largest contributor to the voltage error, as measured by MCM.  Peter points out that the MCM has a 100 kOhm pulldown resistor (presumably to HVDC-).  Given this information, it makes sense that the spoofing circuit on LiBCM PCB drops the voltage, since it places 10 kOhm series resistors between HVDC+ & HVDC.

Therefore, when the battery is at 178 volts... the OBDIIC&C reads 163 volts.  Need to look into more.  MCM doesn't seem to care that the voltage is off by 15 volts (between BATTSCI reporting 178 & MCM'E' measuring 163.

If needed, we can use lower resistance (but higher power) voltage divider.  
We could also just report a lower voltage to the MCM (via BATTSCI).

Ordered the following parts to test on MCM ConnE circuit:


C31
399-16724-1-ND‎ 68 nF

R69 R72
2019-RK73H2ATTD1002FTR-ND‎ 10k 250 mW

R70 R71
541-20.0KTCT-ND‎ 20k 500 mW

Need to populate these parts and see how the circuit behaves.  This is 3.1x more capacitance, but 3.6x less shunting resistance... goal is to keep voltage ripple about the same.
