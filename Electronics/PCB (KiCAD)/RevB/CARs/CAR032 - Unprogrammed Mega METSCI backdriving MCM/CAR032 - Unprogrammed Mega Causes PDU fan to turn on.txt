See if adding a pull-down to RS485 busses prevents powered Mega 5V rail from backdriving through the RS485 into MCM, which then turns fan on.

Need to add pulldown to METSCI_DE... resistor value can be quite high... touching with finger turns it off.  Can't even scope probe signal without changing state.

Didn't need to pulldown BATTSCI_DE... but probably should anyway on next revision.

...

So if we program both LTC1487s to be in "low power mode":
 //METSCI_DE 
 pinMode(2,OUTPUT);
 digitalWrite(2,LOW);

 //BATTSCI_DE
 pinMode(A10,OUTPUT);
 digitalWrite(A10,LOW);

 //METSCI_REn
 pinMode(3,OUTPUT);
 digitalWrite(3,HIGH);

 //BATTSCI_REn
 pinMode(4,OUTPUT);
 digitalWrite(4,HIGH);

...then the relay won't turn on, but we still get voltage leaking into BATTSCI/METSCI rails.  The pullup (R43/R45) and pulldown (R44/R46) resistors (all 1k) tied to the BATTSCI/METSCI lines should inject some current (e.g. 5 volts / 1 k = 5 mA per bus).  This doesn't appear to be enough current to turn the MCM on (enough to energize the fans, at least).

...

So it makes sense then that the pull up/down resistors inject some current (at 2.5 volts no load) into the MCM.  Probably no good way to fix this.

However, we can fix the "fans turn on when Mega unprogrammed" issue by adding a weak pulldown to METSCI_DE.  I've added a 71.5k pulldown to METSCI_DE on the beta boards I've shipped (#004/005/007).

For RevC, need to add pulldown to METSCI_DE & BATTSCI_DE.
