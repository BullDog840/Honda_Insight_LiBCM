2021AUG05 Prototype:003 Changes:
SPI changes:
-cut SPI to BCM connector

//-added LPFs to SPI MOSI/CLK (220 Ohm + 10 nF) -> Tau = 2.2 us | Result: rise time too slow
//-added LPFs to SPI MOSI/CLK (041 Ohm + 10 nF) -> Tau = 0.4 us | Result: rise time borderline
//-added LPFs to SPI MOSI/CLK (020 Ohm + 10 nF) -> Tau = 0.2 us | Result: rise time acceptable
//MISO is harder due to LTC6820's open drain output. 
//-R81 to 1k7, LPF is (20 Ohms +  10 nF) -> Tau = 200 ns | Result: rising edge (pullup) doesn't source current fast enough
//-R81 to 1k0, LPF is (20 Ohms + 250 pF) -> Tau = 005 ns | Result: looks good on scope.
//A more robust method is to buffer MISO near LTC6820 (e.g. opamp).
-All LPFs (MISO/MOSI/CLK changed to (1 kOhm + 20 pF) -> Tau = 20 ns

Overall SPI deadbugging result after test drive: Absolutely no improvement to the error rate.  If anything it's slightly worse (possibly because I slowed the clock down, hence more opportunity for periodic aggressor to corrupt data).

Future SPI changes:
-Increase SPI clock rate to minimize crossover with periodic aggressor signal:
//SPI_CLOCK_DIV16: SPI CLK/MOSI look great.  MISO rising edge too slow... however, no CRC errors sitting on bench.
//SPI_CLOCK_DIV32: SPI CLK/MOSI/MISO look great.
SPI_CLOCK_DIV64: SPI CLK/MOSI/MISO look great.

...

isoSPI changes:
//-isoSPI drive resistors to 1 mA (R_bias = 1.4k, R_icmp = 0.6k)
-cut traces for external isoSPI
//-move downstream 120 Ohm termination to opposite side of transformer (near U11).  
//-remove R130 and C155 entirely (isoSPI safety ground reference).
//-remove stub HV caps so that only most downstream IC is on (and then only ask for its data).
//-replace most downstream HV caps with shorts
//-isoSPI drive resistors to 1 mA (R_bias = 1.00k, R_icmp = 1.00k)(see figure 46). V_thresh = 500 mV
//-isoSPI drive resistors to 1 mA (R_bias = 1.12k, R_icmp = 0.88k)(see figure 47). V_thresh = 560 mV
-isoSPI drive resistors to 1 mA (R_bias = 1.24k, R_icmp = 0.76k)(see figure 47). V_thresh = 620 mV

Future isoSPI changes:
-change C155/C52/C48/etc to 82 pF (20 pF OEM, plus 62 pF).
-change C155/C52/C48/etc to 10 nF (see figure 46 & 48).
-RC snubber on IP/IM at each LTC6804 (see figure 48b)
-switch to single transformers (deadbug duals close to each IC).
-remove ground planes under transformers

"Generally, multi-drop systems are best confined to compact assemblies where they can avoid excessive isoSPI pulse-distortion and EMC pickup."

"Common mode signals will not wake up the serial interface. The interface is designed to wake up after receiving a large signal single-ended pulse, or a low-amplitude symmetric pulse. The differential signal |SCK(IPA) â€“ CSB(IMA)|, must be at least VWAKE = 200mV for a minimum duration of tDWELL = 240ns to qualify as a wake up signal that powers up the serial interface."
