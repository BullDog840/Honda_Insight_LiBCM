2021AUG05 Prototype:003 Changes:
SPI changes:
-cut SPI to BCM connector

-added LPFs to SPI MOSI/CLK (220 Ohm + 10 nF) -> Tau = 2.2 us | Result: rise time too slow
-added LPFs to SPI MOSI/CLK (041 Ohm + 10 nF) -> Tau = 0.4 us | Result: rise time borderline
-added LPFs to SPI MOSI/CLK (020 Ohm + 10 nF) -> Tau = 0.2 us | Result: rise time acceptable

MISO is harder due to LTC6820's open drain output. 
-R81 to 1k7, LPF is 20 Ohms +  10 nF | Result: rising edge doesn't source current fast enough
-R81 to 1k0, LPF is 20 Ohms + 250 pF | Result: looks good on scope.
A more robust method is to buffer MISO near LTC6820 (e.g. opamp).

Overall SPI deadbugging result after test drive: Absolutely no improvement to the error rate.  If anything it's slightly worse (possibly because I slowed the clock down, hence more opportunity for periodic aggressor to corrupt data).

Future SPI changes:
-increase LPF cutoff frequency (25 pF)
-Revert back to RevB OEM.
-Increase SPI clock rate to minimize crossover with periodic aggressor signal.

...

isoSPI changes:
-isoSPI drive resistors to 1 mA (R_bias = 1.4k, R_icmp = 0.6k)
-cut traces for external isoSPI
-move downstream 120 Ohm termination to opposite side of transformer (near U11).  
-remove R130 and C155 entirely (isoSPI safety ground reference).
-remove stub HV caps so that only most downstream IC is on (and then only ask for its data).
-replace most downstream HV caps with shorts

future isoSPI changes:
-replace HV caps on isoSPI stubs with 22 Ohm (see figure 48b).  For safety, requires higher Vwork xformers.
-isoSPI drive resistors to 1 mA (R_bias = 1.0k, R_icmp = 1.0k)(see figure 46)
-isoSPI drive resistors to 1 mA (R_bias = 1.2k, R_icmp = 0.8k)(see figure 47)

-change C155/C52/C48/etc to 82 pF (20 pF OEM, plus 62 pF).
-change C155/C52/C48/etc to 10 nF (see figure 46 & 48).
-R130 to 10k


-RC snubber on IP/IM at each LTC6804 (see figure 48b)
-switch to single transformers (deadbug duals close to each IC).
-remove ground planes under transformers

"Generally, multi-drop systems are best confined to compact assemblies where they can avoid excessive isoSPI pulse-distortion and EMC pickup."

Potential replacement single CMC+CT transformers with higher working voltage:
-1840-1033-2-ND
-118-SM91508AL-ETR-ND

Potential replacement dual CMC+CT transformers with higher working voltage:
-1840-1034-2-ND (larger 14.8x11.7 footprint, existing  12.7 x 8.8).
-507-1724-2-ND (cheaper, but no rated voltage found)

"Common mode signals will not wake up the serial interface. The interface is designed to wake up after receiving a large signal single-ended pulse, or a low-amplitude symmetric pulse. The differential signal |SCK(IPA) â€“ CSB(IMA)|, must be at least VWAKE = 200mV for a minimum duration of tDWELL = 240ns to qualify as a wake up signal that powers up the serial interface."

...

"When configured for master operation, the SLOW pin setting has no effect on the LTC6820 operation."
