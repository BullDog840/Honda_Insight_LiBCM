Lower LPF cutoff on all cell inputs, to minimize noise under heavy regen.

Manual says R > 100 Ohms begins to cause voltage error, which can either be characterized, or add larger capacitor to stiffin inputs.  I propose moving up as close to 100 Ohms as possible, possibly combining with another reel.  Definitely drop 10 nF caps and replace with existing 0805 100 nF caps.

Datasheet says cell-to-cell-to-cell capacitor architecture makes actual LPF cutoff "about an order of magnitude higher than calculations would predict."

Consider adding new 100 Ohm component (replaces 120).  Where 120 ohms needed (e.g. LTC1487 termination), use 100+20.
