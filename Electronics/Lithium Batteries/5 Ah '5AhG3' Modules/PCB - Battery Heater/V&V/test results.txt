Test 2 conclusions:
In 18S-- configuration, both 18S modules have similar temp, and much higher than needed.  For some reason, the 12S module is still lagging far behind.  So we need to increase 12S module power, and also need to decrease 18S module power; there's no reason we need to head pack up to 27 degC when it's -12 outside... that's a 39 degree delta!

So we're going to test the following with 18S--:
-Decrease power in both 18S modules.  Since they're tracking the same, probably decrease them uniformly.
-Increase power in 12S module.
-Retest 18S+- configuration (with better wind shielding).
-I'm going to try setting all three modules to the same power: 17 W

12S ESR (3k9 installed): 1410.5 Ohms
12S V_new: 154.9 volts (17 watts)
Average power into each 12S cell: 1.42 W

18S ESR (3k9 installed): 943.7 Ohms
18S V_new: 126.7 volts 17 watts
Average power into each 18S cell: 0.94 W

Implemented this change at 10:14PM 2022DEC23

...

Test 3: All heater PCBs @ 17 watts (3k9 resistors installed)
The goal of this test is to get the temp sensors in the middle of each module to read the same temperature.  We also need to increase power at each end of all modules, to better balance the temperature gradient.  This will require removing the modules again (which will be test #4).

Test3 started at 10:14PM 2022DEC23, immediately after text2 finished.
Still using 18S-- configuration.

After 2.5 hours, 12S only warmed up 3 degC... so 12S needs even more power (relative to 18S).  I'm gonna give 12S 5 more watts:
12S ESR (3k9 installed): 1410.5 Ohms
12S V_new: 176.0 volts (22 watts)
Average power into each 12S cell: 1.83 W

18S ESR (3k9 installed): 943.7 Ohms
18S V_new: 119.0 volts 15 watts
Average power into each 18S cell: 0.83 W

Implemented this change at 10:14PM 2022DEC23

...

Test 4: Each 12S cell is getting +1 watt more than each 18S cell (1.83 vs 0.83 W).  This doesn't make any sense.

Test4 begins immediately after Test3. 18S--.

12S: 176V@126mA = 22.2 W
18S: 119V@126mA = 15.0 W

Test10:
2022DEC25

Back to 18S-- configuration (we'll deal with 18S+- later).
Quite a few changes:
-Each 18S heater PCB has:
	QTY2 fewer resistors on the 1st closest cell to LiBCM
	QTY2 fewer resistors on the 2nd closest cell to LiBCM
	QTY1 fewer resistor  on the 3rd closest cell to LiBCM
-Each 12S heater PCB is unmodified from previous tests.
-There's a 10 watt resistor bolted to the aluminum plate on each module.

Cells were inside for four hours, giving them time to heat back up.
Verified cells were all the same temperature with thermal imager.

12S: 163V@116mA = 18.9W
